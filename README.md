### Hi, I'm Vincent!  
I currently study computer science and mathematics at Northeastern University. My personal work centers around finding unconventional uses for augmented reality that are powered by advanced algorithms. I also lead inclusive workshops that aim to make the tech industry accessible and inviting to everyone. Thanks for checking out my projects!

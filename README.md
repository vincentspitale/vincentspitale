### Hi, I'm Vincent! (he/they)
I currently study computer science and mathematics at Northeastern University. My personal work centers around tools for ideation and creativity. With software, we can reinvent creative expression to have less constraints than past mediums. I find it exhilerating to imagine ways art and ideas can be heightened in new forms.
